- 👋 Hi, I’m @eborchardt
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much anything related to making things, hardware / software / materials.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on building a MIDI foot pedal to control some guitar effects on Raspberry Pi. I've been messing 
      with Ubuntu Studio and Patch OS, trying to decide which I like better. I started by using a Circuit Playground Express to monitor
      the buttons and send the MIDI signal. Then I switched to an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 that I had collecting dust. I was finally
      able to purchase a Raspberry Pi Pico and now I have converted my code to that board. I'm looking forward to adding some 
      sort of display or series of displays to be used for a UI.
- 💞️ I’m always looking for ways I can contribute my experience and enjoy a good challenge. Feel free to reach out if 
      you have something I can help you with.
